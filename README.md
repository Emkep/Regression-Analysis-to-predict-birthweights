# Predicting birthweight with regression analysis<br>
<b>Objective:</b> Objective is to predict birthweights of babies in the United States from a dataset containing 196 birthweights. The explanatory variables for this regression analysis were the mothers’ age, drinking and smoking habits, education, race, pre-natal care, fathers’ age, race, education, etc.<br><br>
<b>Models:</b> OLS, Lasso and ARD models were used to predict the birthweights from the given dataset.<br><br>
<b>Programming Language:</b> Python (Scikit-learn)<br><br>
<b>Conclusion:</b> OLS is observed to be the best model to predict the birthweight in this case and it gives Train and Test R-squareds of 67.57% and 72.62% respectively. The resulting Train-Test gap was 4.95%. The most significant explanatory variables were found to be the mother’s drinking habit, toxic (combined effect of smoking and drinking habits of a mother), and the father’s age with coefficients of negative 83.22, negative 36.84 and negative 13.94 respectively.
